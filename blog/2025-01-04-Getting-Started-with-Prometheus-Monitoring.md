# Getting Started with Prometheus Monitoring

Prometheus is a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that has become the de facto standard for monitoring cloud-native applications.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is a time-series database that collects metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are met.

## Key Features

- Multi-dimensional data model with time series data
- Flexible query language (PromQL)
- No reliance on distributed storage
- Pull model over HTTP
- Service discovery and static configuration

## Getting Started

To begin using Prometheus, you'll need to:

1. Download and install Prometheus
2. Configure your targets
3. Set up alerting rules
4. Integrate with visualization tools like Grafana
